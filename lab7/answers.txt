Lab 7: GDB


1. What is the command to compile the files with extra symbols that are useful for GDB?
- gcc -g filename1 filename2 filename... -o yourExecutableFileName

2. What's the address of stuff?
- 0x7fffffffbcb0

3. What's the address of stuff[0]?
- 0x7fffffffbcb0

4. Do we expect these to be the same? Why? Explain what the [ ] operator does in C.
Yes, first element and the name of the array are always the same address. [] gives you the address of the element of the array. 

5. In Blowfish_Init( ), what is the value of key?
- LAME_KEY

6. What command(s) did you type in order to learn this?
- "watch key"
- and "continue"

7. In Blowfish_Init( ), what are the values of i and j after the nested for loops have finished?
i.e., after:
for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) 
for (j = 0; j < 256; j++){
ctx->S[i][j] = ORIG_S[i][j];
}
- i = 4
- j = 256

8. What command(s) did you type in order to learn this?
- list Blowfish_Init
- Break 723
- print i
- print j

9. Before the Blowfish_Encrypt function is called, what is the value of stuff[3] (for each, print
the value, and the command used to obtain the value):
o in hex? - print /x sutff[3] 0x0
o in binary? - print /t sutff[3] 0
o as a float? - print /t *(float *)&stuff[3] 0
o as 4 chars? - print /x *((char *)&stuff[3])@4 {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}

10. Before the Blowfish_Encrypt function is called, what is the value of stuff if we treat it as a
string? (You don't have to write the whole string. Just describe what's there.) What was the
command typed in order to obtain this value?
- sesame street: people in your neighborhood with bob script
- gdb GDBassign
- break 371
- run- x/s stuff

11. What is the value of x the first time that the function F() in Blowfish.c is called?
- 1753098189

12. What is the output if we run GDB's backtrace (abbreviated "bt") command inside the function
F() in Blowfish.c the first time F() is called? Briefly explain the output of the command in your
own words.
- #0  F (ctx=0x7fffffffd320, x=1753098189) at blowfish.c:551
- #1  0x0000555555555289 in Blowfish_Encrypt (ctx=0x7fffffffd320, xl=0x7fffffffbc50, xr=0x7fffffffbc54) at blowfish.c:603
- #2  0x00005555555554f0 in Blowfish_Init (ctx=0x7fffffffd320, key=0x5555555570a0 "LAME_KEY", keyLen=8) at blowfish.c:755
- #3  0x0000555555555738 in main () at gdbassign.c:383
